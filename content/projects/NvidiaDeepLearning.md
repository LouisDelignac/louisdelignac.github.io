### Course summary
###### Course followed from May 3, 2025 to May 10, 2025

I completed this 8-hour, hands-on course offered by the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, structured into 7 modules. This course deepened my understanding of how deep learning works and allowed me to build practical skills through a series of real-world projects in computer vision and natural language processing.

Throughout the course, I explored the theoretical foundations of neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks and very deep pre-trained models. I also gained experience in data preprocessing, data augmentation, and Natural Language Processing with BERT.

As part of the practical component, I completed the following deep learning projects:
- Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNIST dataset, with an application in manuscript cipher inference.
- American Sign Language Alphabet Recognition, focused on identifying individual letters.
- Dog Breed Classification, trained to recognize a specific breed from images.
- Fruit Image Clustering, using an open Kaggle dataset to group similar fruit images.

This course reinforced the foundational knowledge I acquired during the "Introduction to Deep Learning" class in my Master's program at the University of Bordeaux. It significantly enhanced my practical skills in both computer vision and NLP through interactive, applied exercises using modern deep learning tools and architectures.
