### Introduction

Getting involved in community and volunteer work means choosing to dedicate time, energy, and ideas to causes greater than ourselves. It's a school of life, a space where we learn to collaborate, lead projects, listen, and take action.

Association work fosters essential skills: teamwork, responsibility, budget or event management, and communication with diverse audiences. But beyond these technical abilities, it cultivates key interpersonal qualities: solidarity, empathy, commitment, and respect for others.

Associative engagement also plays a vital role in society. It builds connections, addresses often overlooked needs, and brings democracy to life on a daily basis. It allows everyone to get involved, feel useful, and contribute to real change-even on a small scale. 

Valuing volunteer and association work means acknowledging that it's not just "free time", but a true driver of learning, transformation, and social progress. It's a source of wealth, both individual and collective, that we must keep alive.

### Label[i]
###### September 2021 - October 2022

Label[i] is the student association of the Computer Science department at the University of Bordeaux. It organizes educational and community-building events.

I was elected president in a post-COVID context, with the objective of revitalizing the association, increasing its visibility among students, and organizing the annual event "La Nuit de l'Info".

Key achievements during my mandate included:
- Recruiting and managing a team, with clear distribution of responsibilities.
- Establishing a student lounge to promote the association on campus.
- Organizing various social events, such as a welcome party and game night.
- Creating stands at university association fairs to attract new members.
- Joining the local student association network to foster collaboration.
- Coordinating the "Nuit de l'Info" event, which gathered over 300 participants.

By the end of my term, the association had grown to over 100 active members.

#### Nuit de l'Info

La Nuit de l'Info is a national competition that brings together students, faculty, and companies to collaborate on the development of a web application. The event takes place annually on the first Thursday of December, running from sunset to sunrise the following morning. Participants have just one night to propose, implement, and package a Web 2.0 application.

Each year, the student associations Label[i], ABEII, and AMBB, with the support of the Computer Science Department (UF Informatique) and the Computer Science Institute (IUT Informatique), take over the university's computer science building to host the 300+ local participants in Bordeaux.

Students can visit booths from partner companies offering activities and job-dating sessions, and enjoy various animations throughout the night. Volunteers ensure that participants have everything they need to make the most of the competition.

###### September 2023 - August 2024

The Mayday Festival is a purpose-driven music festival, organized entirely by student volunteers. Its core values center around ecological and social transitions, inclusivity, and community sharing.
