### Introduction
######

Volunteering in the nonprofit sector means making the deliberate choice to devote your time, skills, and energy to a meaningful project, in service of a cause or a community that is close to your heart.

This commitment opens the door to rich and diverse human encounters, fostering a genuine openness to the world. It's also a remarkable learning ground, where practical skills such as teamwork, taking on responsibility, project and budget management, as well as communication, are developed. Moreover, the nonprofit sector is a space for passing on fundamental values such as solidarity, respect for the environment, citizenship, and inclusion.

Associations play an essential role in our society. Each year in France, more than 11 million people volunteer at least once, and over 20 million are members of at least one association, according to data from the National Institute for Youth and Popular Education (INJEP).

Volunteering is another way of spending one's free time: giving rather than consuming. While it is an unpaid activity, it is a meaningful and fulfilling commitment that deeply enriches those who engage in it, humanly, socially, and sometimes even professionally.

On a personal level, this commitment has profoundly transformed me. It has taught me to collaborate with people from different backgrounds, to step out of my comfort zone, to gain self-confidence and overcome my shyness. It has enabled me to feel useful, to place my actions within a broader context beyond my own personal path, and to bring meaning to what I do. Some of the encounters I've had in this setting have left a lasting impact on my life, shaped my choices, and given new meaning to my career path.

### Label[i]
###### September 2021 - October 2022

Label[i] is the student association of the Computer Science department at the University of Bordeaux. It organizes educational and community-building events.

I was elected president in a post-COVID context, with the objective of revitalizing the association, increasing its visibility among students, and organizing the annual event "La Nuit de l'Info".

Key achievements during my mandate included:
- Recruiting and managing a team, with clear distribution of responsibilities.
- Establishing a student lounge to promote the association on campus.
- Organizing various social events, such as a welcome party and game night.
- Creating stands at university association fairs to attract new members.
- Joining the local student association network to foster collaboration.
- Coordinating the "Nuit de l'Info" event, which gathered over 300 participants.

By the end of my term, the association had grown to over 100 active members.

#### Nuit de l'Info 2021

La Nuit de l'Info is a national competition that brings together students, faculty, and companies to collaborate on the development of a web application. The event takes place annually on the first Thursday of December, running from sunset to sunrise the following morning. Participants have just one night to propose, implement, and package a Web 2.0 application.

Each year, the student associations Label[i], ABEII, and AMBB, with the support of the Computer Science Department (UF Informatique) and the Computer Science Institute (IUT Informatique), take over the university's computer science building to host the 300+ local participants in Bordeaux.

Students can visit booths from partner companies offering activities and job-dating sessions, and enjoy various animations throughout the night. Volunteers ensure that participants have everything they need to make the most of the competition.
