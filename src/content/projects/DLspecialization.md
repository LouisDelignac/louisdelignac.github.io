### Course summary
###### Course followed from December 3, 2025 to January 16, 2026

The [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by DeepLearning.AI is taught by [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng). It is a benchmark course on neural networks that I completed independently while looking for a job. Following my Master's in Statistical Modeling, my goal was to dive deeper into this field I'm passionate about and get into the details of specific technologies like CNNs and RNNs.

During this approximately 125-hour course, which combines video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments, I was able to:

- Implement various complex architectures (YOLO, LSTMs, Transformers, etc.).
- Apply best practices for managing Deep Learning projects.
- Solve concrete use cases (object detection, chatbots, speech recognition, etc.).

This training was a truly enriching experience. I genuinely enjoyed getting up in the morning to watch the lectures, Andrew is an excellent instructor!
