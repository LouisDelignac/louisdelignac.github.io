### Presentation of the study
###### Completed from February 2024 to May 2024

The fields of machine learning and operations research sometimes involve complex problems where an **exhaustive approach is not suitable**. In response to this challenge, we worked on the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, which offers an **effective heuristic method** for exploring the solution space.

**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** is a heuristic search technique used in decision-making processes. Initially developed to solve complex problems such as the game of Go, this method has since been applied to various fields, including neural networks, as it allows for solving problems where exhaustive exploration is too costly. It is characterized by a **probabilistic Monte Carlo approach** to decision-making, using statistical sampling to avoid evaluating all possibilities exhaustively. It employs a search tree to model the problem, where each node represents a specific configuration of the problem, and its children represent the possible subsequent configurations. This approach has proven particularly effective in games with a vast number of possibilities, such as chess, Go, and other board games. In March 2016, AlphaGo, a machine learning algorithm using MCTS, was awarded the honorary 9-dan level (master) after defeating a Go champion.

The aim of this study was to become familiar with **the theory of Monte Carlo Tree Search** and **to illustrate the resolution of certain problems**. In this study, we first explored the fundamental principles of Monte Carlo Tree Search, then detailed the four phases of the algorithm, and finally applied it to a concrete example before concluding with its advantages and limitations.
