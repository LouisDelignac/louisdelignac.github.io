### Project Presentation
###### Completed from September 2023 to December 2023

This project was carried out as a group during the **Analytical Visualization course** in the first year of my Master’s program (CMI ISI). The goal of this project was to create a **Dash** application in **Python** to visualize OpenData. We choose electricity data from [éCO2mix](https://www.rte-france.com/eco2mix) provided by RTE for mainland France (excluding Corsica).

RTE-France is the operator of the French electricity transmission network and has been providing reliable OpenData daily since 2013. The objective of this project is to create visualizations to better understand electricity sector in France and its challenges. Our analysis focuses on 3 main areas: production, consumption, and commercial exchanges. We use **MongoDB** as our database.

We retrieved our data using APIs from 4 datasets available on the **ODRE Opendatasoft** platform:
- [Real-time national data](https://odre.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/eco2mix-national-tr)
- [Consolidated national data](https://odre.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/eco2mix-regional-cons-def)
- [Real-time regional data](https://odre.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/eco2mix-regional-tr)
- [Consolidated regional data](https://odre.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/eco2mix-regional-cons-def)

### Data Overview
######

We have four datasets: two at the national level and two at the regional level. For each geographical level, one dataset contains real-time data going back up to one year, while the other consists of consolidated and final data available from January 2013 up to year Y-1.

These datasets contain the following data:
- Electricity trade with neighboring countries
- Electricity production by sources at the national level or at the regional level
- Estimate of carbon emissions generated by electricity production
- Electricity consumption in metropolitan France (excluding Corsica)
- Electricity consumption forecasts established the day before (D-1) and those updated on the same day (D)


### Database with MongoDB
######

<!-- Pourquoi MongoDB ? => données temporelles, db documents
PyMongo

Requests pour fill DB depuis l'API

dans notre cas: on peut fusion des datasets consolidées et temps réel

### Dash Application and Plotly Visualisations
######

<!-- Dash, Plotly and Pandas presentation -->

The visualizations in our application help to better understand the electricity sector and its challenges, in order to address various key questions such as:
- What are the main modes of electricity production in France? And by region?
- How has the share of renewable energy in the French energy mix evolved over the past decade?
- What is France’s energy trade balance?
- How do electricity production and consumption evolve over the course of a day? A month? A year?

#### Home Page

On this page, three cards provide access to the different analysis sections of our project. Further down, information is presented about the context of the electricity network in France, as well as the sources of the data used. Finally, a button allows the database to be updated.

#### Trade

On this page, various charts display France's electricity trade with its neighboring countries. The first chart shows the distribution of trade (imports and exports), while the other two highlight their volumes. A selector allows you to choose a time range to focus on a specific period. Below, you’ll find information about electricity exchanges and an general analysis of these charts.

#### Production

On this page, various charts display electricity production in France. The first two sections are dedicated to production by sector at the national and regional levels. One selector allows for comparing the production of two regions (in terms of volume and energy mix), while another lets you choose the time period to view. A third section shows the evolution of renewable energy production in France through a GIF. Finally, the last section provides information about electricity production and a general analysis of these charts.

#### Consumption

On this page, various charts display electricity consumption in France. The first and third charts show regional consumption, while the second one presents national consumption along with forecasts for the current day and the following day. A selector allows you to choose a time range to focus on a specific period. Below, you’ll find information about electricity exchanges and an general analysis of these charts.
